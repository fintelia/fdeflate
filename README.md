A fast, safe, and modern zlib implementation for PNG.

## Overview

This crate contains an optimized implementation of the [deflate algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate) tuned for PNG images, but capable of handling arbitrary data. It was created to serve as the compression backend for the [`png`](https://crates.io/crates/png) crate, but can be used as a standalone library. The upcoming 0.4.x series features a fully compatible streaming encoder supporting uncompressed output, traditional levels 1-9, and two specialized compression levels designed for PNG images.

## Performance

### Decompression

The decoder employs several modern features than help it achieve exceptional performance that rivals the performance of `zlib-ng` and `zlib-rs` without using any `unsafe` code:

* It uses larger Huffman tables with up to 4096 entries, to better make use of the larger L1 caches available on modern processors.
* [Multi-byte literal decoding](https://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2015/10/huffman-revisited-part-4-multi-bytes.html) enables decoding two literals with a single table lookup. Since PNG data often seems to have a higher percentage of literals, this is particularly helpful for them.
* Optimized Huffman table construction that requires fewer random writes.

### Compression

[Preliminary benchmark data](https://github.com/image-rs/fdeflate/pull/53) shows that `fdeflate` is currently faster than `zlib-rs` for levels 1-3 and is comparable for levels 4-7. Compression performance is a tradeoff between speed and compression ratio, so it is notable that this is achieved without compromising compression ratio.

Internally, `fdeflate` (like other compression libraries) maps different compression levels to different algorithms and parameters.


### Ultra-fast compression

The "ultra-fast" compression level is several _times_ faster than other modes while still providing some amount of compression. It is designed to be performance-competitive with [`QOI`](https://qoiformat.org/) while still being compatible with zlib. It does so by making a bunch of simplifying assumptions:

- Exactly one block per deflate stream.
- No distance codes except for run length encoding of zeros.
- A single fixed Huffman tree trained on a large corpus of PNG images.
- All Huffman codes are <= 12 bits.
